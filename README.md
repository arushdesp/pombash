# Pombash

A simple, command-line Pomodoro timer to help you focus directly from your terminal.

# Installation

## Add to your Shell

Copy the entire `pomo()` function script and paste it at the end of your `~/.bashrc` (for Bash) or `~/.zshrc` (for Zsh) file.

## Reload your Shell

Open a new terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` (or `source ~/.zshrc`) to make the command available.

**Note:** Requires `sqlite3`. Most systems have it, but if not, install it with `sudo apt install sqlite3` or `brew install sqlite3`.
